### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, they were very helpful! I was completely new to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I feel like I learned so much in such a short amount of time.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would make sure my add playlist form was functional. I managed to add it to the website and allow users to type however I would like to work on it more
and make sure the playlists add to the homescreen.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I was very happy with my search bar and getting it to update the home page dynamically! I didn't have enough time to completely finish my add playlist form which didn't go as planned.
My peer Bryan had a feature which when you hovered on a playlist it would animate.

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

Joy was a great help to me! We collaborated many times together and helped each other out when stuck, which showed me how working with peers in the workplace will actually be like.
Additionally, the instructor Henry was very kind and helped me alot with my submission problem!
